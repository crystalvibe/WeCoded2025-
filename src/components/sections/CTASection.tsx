/**
 * Call to Action (CTA) Section Component
 * 
 * This component is a placeholder for a call-to-action section.
 * Currently, it's an empty section that was previously removed as requested.
 * 
 * Potential uses:
 * - Newsletter signup
 * - Community join prompt
 * - Link to submit stories
 * - Special announcements
 * 
 * The component imports Button and icon components which suggests it was 
 * previously used for interactive call-to-action elements.
